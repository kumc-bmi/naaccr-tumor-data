<br/><strong>NAACCR XML</strong>: Tumor.casefindingSource<br/><br/>


<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para mark-changed'>This variable codes the earliest source of identifying information. For cases identified by a source other than reporting facilities (such as through death clearance or as a result of an audit), this variable codes the type of source through which the tumor was first identified. This data item cannot be used by itself as a data quality indicator. The timing of the casefinding processes (e.g., death linkage) varies from registry to registry, and the coded value of this variable is a function of that timing.</div>
<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para mark-changed'>This data item will help reporting facilities as well as regional and central registries in prioritizing their casefinding activities. It will identify reportable tumors that were first found through death clearance or sources other than traditional reporting facilities. It provides more detail than "Type of Reporting Source."<br/><br/><strong>Coding Instructions<strong><br/></strong></strong>This variable is intended to code the source that first identified the tumor. Determine where the case was first identified and enter the appropriate code. At the regional or central level, if a hospital and a non-hospital source identified the case independently of each other, enter the code for the non-hospital source (i.e., codes 30-95 have priority over codes 10-29). If the case was first identified at a reporting facility (codes 10-29), code the earliest source (based on patient or specimen contact at the facility) of identifying information.<br/><br/>If a death certificate, independent pathology laboratory report, consultation-only report from a hospital, or other report was used to identify a case that was then abstracted from a different source, enter the code for the source that first identified the case, not the source from which it was subsequently abstracted. If a regional or central registry identifies a case and asks a reporting facility to abstract it, enter the code that corresponds to the initial source, not the code that corresponds to the eventual reporting facility.
