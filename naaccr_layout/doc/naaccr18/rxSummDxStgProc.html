    <em>Note: </em>CoC recommends this item for tumors diagnosed 1996 and forward. For tumors diagnosed before 1996, this item may have been converted, and tumors with surgery would have been converted to 09 in this field. See also RX Summ--Surg Prim Site [1290] and RX Summ--Reconstruct 1st [1330]. For SEER and pre-1996 CoC, see RX Summ--Surgery Type [1640]. For tumors diagnosed between 1996 and 2002 this field may have described palliative care. For tumors diagnosed on or after January 1, 2003, palliative care is coded in a new field RX Summ--Palliative Proc [3270].
