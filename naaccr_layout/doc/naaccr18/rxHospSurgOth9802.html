<strong>Alternate Names</strong>
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surgery of Other Regional Site(s), Distant Site(s), or Distant Lymph Node(s) at this Facility (CoC)
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surgical Procedure/Other Site at this Facility


<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para mark-changed'>Records the surgical removal of distant lymph nodes or other tissue(s)/organ(s) beyond the primary site at this facility. This field is to be used for
    <em>ROADS</em> codes after the <em>ROADS</em> to
    <em>FORDS</em> conversion. It is also to be used to code Surgery Other Regional/Distant Sites at the reporting facility for all tumors diagnosed before January 1, 2003.
</div>
<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para mark-changed'>The removal of non-primary tissue documents the extent of surgical treatment and is useful in evaluating the extent of metastatic involvement.
    <br/><br/>If central registries wish to study the treatment given at particular facilities, the facility-level treatment fields must be used. The summary treatment fields, conversely, combine information for all reporting facilities that provide first course of treatment for the tumor. Facility-specific fields allow studies of detailed referral patterns and treatment by type of healthcare setting. Knowing what part of the treatment was given at a particular facility also helps resolve consolidation issues.
