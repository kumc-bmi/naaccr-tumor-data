<br/><strong>NAACCR XML</strong>: Tumor.followUpContactState<br/><br/>


<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para mark-changed'>USPS abbreviation for the state (including U.S. territories, commonwealths, or possessions), or Canada Post abbreviation for the Canadian province/territory of the follow-up contact&#8217;s current usual residence. If the patient has multiple tumors, the follow-up contact state should be the same for all tumors. Effective with NAACCR Volume II, Version 13, a new data item, FollowUp Contact--Country [1847] was added to the standard transmission record layout. The UDS Committee expects the new item to supplement the use of Follow-Up Contact--State [1844].</div>
<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para mark-changed'>Sometimes registries carry out follow-up by contacting the patient and other contacts by a letter or phone call to ascertain their vital status. When a patient's current address is unknown or the patient is for some reason not to be contacted (e.g., patient is a minor child), the most current name, address and phone number of another contact, such as a relative or neighbor are needed. This information may also be useful for conducting research studies.</div>
