<br/><strong>NAACCR XML</strong>: Tumor.followUpContactName<br/><br/>


<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para mark-changed'>First and last name, in natural order, of a person, other than the patient or a physician, who can be contacted to obtain follow-up information for the patient. If the patient has multiple tumors, Follow-up Contact-Name should be the same for all tumors.</div>
<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para mark-changed'>Sometimes registries carry out follow-up by contacting the patient and other contacts by a letter or phone call to ascertain their vital status. When a patient's current address is unknown or the patient is for some reason not to be contacted (e.g., patient is a minor child), the most current name, address and phone number of another contact, such as a relative or neighbor are needed. This information may also be useful for conducting research studies.</div>
